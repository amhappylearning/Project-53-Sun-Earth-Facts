  <h2> <u> Facts about SUN: </u></h2>
      <p> Facts & Summary
  The Sun is located in the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, essentially, a hot ball of glowing gases.
  It is the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
  The Sun has a diameter of around 1.39 million kilometers / 864,000 miles. This is 109 times greater than the diameter of our planet.
  The Sun’s mass consists of 73% hydrogen, 25% helium, and smaller amounts of oxygen, carbon, neon, iron, and other elements.
  The Sun is so massive that it accounts for 99.86% of the total mass of the entire Solar  System.
  The Sun currently fuses around 600 million tons of hydrogen into helium every second. It is converting 4 million tons of matter into energy every second as a result.
  This energy is the source of the Sun’s light and heat. It can take between 10,000 and 170,000 years for this energy to escape from the Sun’s core.
  Every star is classified based upon their physical characteristics. Our Sun is labeled as a G-type main-sequence star or G2V.
  The Sun is approximately 4.6 billion years old.
  Many cultures from around the world associated the Sun with their most important deity or a very prominent one, and for good reason! Without the Sun, we wouldn’t exist.
  The connection and interactions between the Sun and Earth drive the seasons, ocean currents, weather, climate, radiation belts, and aurorae.
  Though there are billions of stars in the galaxy, our Sun will always be the most special star.
  The Sun spins once every 25 days, but at its poles, it rotates once every 35 days.
  The Sun’s core is about 27 million degrees Fahrenheit / 15 million degrees Celsius.</p>

  <h2> <u>Facts about EARTH:</u> </h2>
      <p> Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. The majority of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice, including the Antarctic ice sheet and the sea ice of the Arctic ice pack. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.
